 1. ABOUT
----------
This directory houses the code base for the Rasberry Pi client code. The code 
is responsible for the detection of gunshots, and relaying the time & location
that said gunshot was detected. Afterwords, the client resumes listening for 
other gunshots, and the process repeats.

----------
 2. CONFIGURATION
----------

The majority of program configuration is done in the CONFIG file that sits in the
same directory as the executable. The CONFIG file is a simple list of key-value 
pairs. An example is shown below:

port = 1337
server = 192.168.1.1
